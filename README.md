A dataset for detecting paraphrasing errors
The dataset contains 6000 paraphrases for 40 canonical sentences. Each paraphrase is annotated with one of the following labels:
- Correct
- Misspelling
- Linguistic Error
- Cheating
- Answering
- Semantic Error
- Translation

## Possible Usecases
- Automatic Paraphrasing Issue Detection
- Cheating Detection in Crowdsourced Paraphrases
- Paraphrase Generation
- Semantic Textual Similarity
- Sentence Embedding
- Gramatical Error Detection/Correction
